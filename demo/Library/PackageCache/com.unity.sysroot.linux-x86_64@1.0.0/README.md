This package provides a sysroot for building linux x86_64 players.

Please note that the components of the SDK are subject to a variety of
licenses detailed in the LICENSE.md file. While Unity itself does not
use any of the provided libraries in a way that triggers any copyleft
effects, you need to make sure that if you use native code in your
project, said code adheres to the requirements of the licenses
mentioned above. Specifically, the GCC runtime is subject to a GPL
license, but it is also subject to the GCC runtime linking exception
which applies to how the Unity player is using it.

This package is available as a pre-release package, so it is still in the process of becoming stable enough to release. The features and documentation in this package might change before it is ready for release.
